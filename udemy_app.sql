It doesn’t just cover a small portion of the industry. This covers everything you need to know to get hired: from absolute zero knowledge to being able to put things on your resume that will allow you to live the life you want. \r\n\r\nSounds too good to be true? Give me 5 minutes of your time to explain to you why I built this course and what is different here than thousands of other courses all over the internet.\r\n\r\nThere is no wasted time here. We won’t be using outdated technologies like PHP, Wordpress and JQuery. Although still useful, outdated technologies like the above are low paying and demands for them are decreasing. In this course, you will learn the specific technologies that are the most in demand in the industry right now. These include tools and technologies used by the biggest tech companies like Google, Facebook, Instagram, etc… It’s geared specifically for people that want to learn employable skills in 2018.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing this course, you will be able to apply for developer roles, or upgrade your job title as a developer and earn a higher salary. We won\'t be taking any shortcuts in this course. I am going to take your from absolute zero, where I teach you how the internet works, to mastery, where I show you how to build an image recognition app using a Machine Learning API (a subset of Artificial Intelligence).\r\n\r\nThis course is taught by an instructor who has worked in silicon valley, and one of the top tech companies in Toronto. I have built large scale applications, and have managed a team of developers. I have worked directly with these technologies. I am not an online marketer or a salesman. I am a senior software developer who loves programming and believes that there needs to be a course out there that actually teaches valuable skills.\r\n\r\nI know your time is valuable. You want a course that outlines the best way to learn the topic in simple, well explained methods so that you fully understand topics instead of watching somebody on your screen and having no clue what is going on. I have created this course after consuming hundreds of books, tutorials, and online courses while I was learning. I have taken the best pieces, the best methods, that I have found, and condensed everything so that you can learn in the most efficient way possible. 50 hours of videos doesn\'t mean much if the instructor isn\'t engaging or focuses on outdated topics. \r\nIn this course, you will be taken through online videos and exercises where you will be able to do the following things by the end:\r\n\r\nBuild real complex applications and websites\r\nBuild an image recognition app together at the end of the course so you can add it to your portfolio\r\nGo into a job interview confident that you understand the fundamental building blocks of web development and the developer space in 2018\r\nBe able to go off on your own and grow your skills as a developer having built a solid foundation\r\nLearn how front-end, servers, and databases communicate and how they all fit together in the eco system\r\nBuild your own startup landing page. \r\nGo off and remotely work by being a freelance developer and bid on projects.\r\nKnow EXACLTY what a day in the life of a developer is like and what the day to day technologies and tools will be that you are using. \r\nBy the end of this course you will be comfortable using the below skills and you will be able to put them on your resume:\r\n\r\nHTML5\r\nCSS\r\nBootstrap 4\r\nJavascript\r\nReact\r\nGit + Github\r\nNode.js\r\nExpress.js\r\nNPM\r\nPostgresSQL\r\nSQL\r\nThis course is the accumulation of all of my years working, learning, and teaching coding and all of the frustrations and incomplete information I have encountered along the way. There is so much information out there, so many opinions, and so many ways of doing things, that unless you have spent the last years working with these technologies in a company, you will never fully understand. So this course is the answer to that exact problem. I have gone through thousands of coding books and online tutorials and bootcamps. I have worked with these tools on real applications. Throughout the years I have taken notes on what has worked, and what hasn\'t and I\'ve created this course to narrow down the best way to learn and the most relevant information. \r\n\r\nI will succeed if you succeed in this course. Therefore, I will be there every step of the way helping you understand concepts and answer any questions you have.\r\n\r\nI am 100% confident that you won\'t find a course like this out there that is as well organized, and as useful, to build a strong foundation for you to start a new career. We\'re not going to be building simple todo applications and cat image sliders. We are going to learn actual practical skills that will put you into the workforce. Some unique sections that you won\'t find anywhere else are:\r\n\r\nReact.js: you will learn the library that companies like Netflix, Facebook and Instagram use to build fast, scalable applications. This is one of the highest in-demand skill in the industry.\r\nA day in the life of a developer: What will your day to day look like and what tools will you use? I will take you through a sample day at a tech company.\r\nHow does the internet actually work. What is the history of these technologies: I will actually have you understand the underlying concepts of the internet, and how the technologies we have now, have come to be where they are.\r\nHow do you actually deploy a real life app so that it is secure, and won\'t get hacked: How does a real life app get out to the public?\r\nWhat is Machine learning and how you can harness it\'s power: Whether you have heard about it or not, this is something that you will hear more and more in the coming years. Those who understand the high level concepts and can harness it will have an advantage. \r\nWhat is your developer environment on your computer look like: We will be setting up our computers with all the tools necessary of a developer so you can use the same setup when you go into the workforce.\r\nWhy do we teach the above? Because in this day and age, just knowing HTML CSS and Javascript is not good enough and you won\'t be able to grow in your role and command a higher salary. I am teaching you these things because these are the things you should know in 2018 so that you are miles ahead of the rest. \r\n\r\nMake this the year that you took a risk, you learned highly in demand skills, you had new experiences, and you received new opportunities. I hope you join me in this journey. \r\n\r\nThis is the proudest work I have ever done in my life and I am confident that you won\'t find a course better than this. \r\n\r\nSee you inside!\r\n\r\nTaught by: \r\nAndrei has been working as a senior software developer in Silicon Valley and Toronto for many years.

margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">Artificial intelligence is growing exponentially. There is no doubt about that. Self-driving cars are clocking up millions of miles, IBM Watson is diagnosing patients better than armies of doctors and Google Deepmind\'s AlphaGo beat the World champion at Go - a game where intuition plays a key role.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">But the further AI advances, the more complex become the problems it needs to solve. And only Deep Learning can solve such complex problems and that\'s why it\'s at the heart of Artificial intelligence.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">--- Why Deep&nbsp;Learning A-Z? ---</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">Here are five reasons we think Deep Learning A-Z&trade;&nbsp;really is different and stands out from the crowd of&nbsp;other training programs out there:</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">1. ROBUST STRUCTURE&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">The first and most important thing we focused on is giving the course a robust structure. Deep Learning is very broad and complex and to navigate this maze you need a clear and global vision of it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">That\'s why we grouped the tutorials into two volumes, representing the two fundamental branches of Deep Learning: Supervised Deep Learning and Unsupervised Deep Learning.&nbsp;With each volume focusing on three distinct algorithms, we found that this is the best structure for mastering Deep Learning.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">2. INTUITION TUTORIALS</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">So many courses and books just bombard you with the theory, and math, and coding... But they forget to explain, perhaps, the most important part:&nbsp;<span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">why you are doing what you are doing.&nbsp;</span>And that\'s how this course is so different. We focus on developing an intuitive&nbsp;<em style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">*feel*</em>&nbsp;for the concepts behind Deep Learning algorithms.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">With our intuition tutorials you will be confident that you understand all the techniques on an instinctive level. And once you proceed to the hands-on coding exercises you will see for yourself how much more meaningful your experience will be.&nbsp;This is a game-changer.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">3.

Well then you\'re in for a treat.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">Inside this class we will work on Real-World datasets, to solve Real-World business problems. (Definitely not the boring iris or digit classification datasets that we see in every course). In this course we will solve six real-world challenges:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; list-style-position: initial; list-style-image: initial; padding: 0px 0px 0px 35px;\">\r\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Artificial Neural Networks to solve a Customer Churn problem</li>\r\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Recognition</li>\r\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Recurrent&nbsp;Neural Networks to predict Stock Prices</li>\r\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Self-Organizing Maps to investigate Fraud</li>\r\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Boltzmann Machines to create a Recomender System</li>\r\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Stacked Autoencoders* to take on the challenge for the&nbsp;<span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">Netflix $1 Million prize</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\"><em style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">*Stacked Autoencoders is a brand new technique in Deep Learning which didn\'t even exist a couple of years ago.

HANDS-ON CODING&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">In&nbsp;Deep Learning A-Z&trade; we code together with you.&nbsp;Every practical tutorial starts with a blank page and we write up the code from scratch. This way you can follow along and understand exactly how the code comes together and what each line means.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">In addition, we will purposefully structure the code in such a way so that you can download it and apply it in your own projects.&nbsp;Moreover, we explain step-by-step where and how to modify the code to insert YOUR dataset, to tailor the algorithm to your needs, to get the output that you are after.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">This is a course which naturally extends into your career.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">5. IN-COURSE SUPPORT</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">Have you ever taken a course or read a book where you have questions but cannot reach the author?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">Well, this course is different. We are fully committed to making this the most disruptive and powerful Deep Learning course on the planet. With that comes a responsibility to constantly be there when you need our help.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">In fact, since we physically also need to eat and sleep we have put together a team of professional Data Scientists to help us out. Whenever you ask a question you will get a response from us within 48 hours maximum.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">No matter how complex your query, we will be there.&nbsp;The bottom line is we want you to succeed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">---&nbsp;The Tools&nbsp;---</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">Tensorflow and Pytorch are the two most popular open-source libraries for Deep Learning. In this course you will learn both!</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">TensorFlow was developed by Google and is used in their speech recognition system, in the new google photos product, gmail, google search and much more. Companies using Tensorflow include AirBnb, Airbus, Ebay, Intel, Uber and dozens more.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">PyTorch is as just as powerful and is being developed by researchers at Nvidia and leading universities: Stanford, Oxford, ParisTech. Companies using PyTorch include Twitter, Saleforce and Facebook.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">So which is better and for what?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">Well, in this course you will have an opportunity to work with both and understand when Tensorflow is better and when PyTorch is the way to go. Throughout the tutorials we compare the two and give you tips and ideas on which could work best in certain circumstances.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">The interesting thing is that both these libraries are barely over 1 year old. That\'s what we mean when we say that in this course we teach you the most cutting edge Deep Learning models and techniques.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">--- More&nbsp;Tools&nbsp;---</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\"><em style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Theano&nbsp;</em>is another open source deep learning library. It\'s very similar to Tensorflow in its functionality, but nevertheless we will still cover it.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\"><em style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Keras&nbsp;</em>is an incredible library to implement Deep Learning models. It acts as a wrapper for Theano and Tensorflow. Thanks to Keras we can create powerful and complex Deep Learning models with only a few lines of code. This is what will allow you to have a global vision of what you are creating. Everything you make will look so clear and structured thanks to this library, that you will really get the intuition and understanding of what you are doing.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">--- Even More&nbsp;Tools&nbsp;---</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\"><em style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Scikit-learn&nbsp;</em>the most practical Machine Learning library. We will mainly use it: &nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; list-style-position: initial; list-style-image: initial; padding: 0px 0px 0px 35px;\">\r\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">to evaluate the performance of our models with the most relevant technique, k-Fold Cross Validation</li>\r\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">to improve our models with effective Parameter Tuning</li>\r\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">to preprocess our data, so that our models can learn in the best conditions</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">And of course, we have to mention the usual suspects. This whole course is based on Python and in every single section you will be getting hours and hours of invaluable hands-on practical coding experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">Plus, throughout the course we will be using&nbsp;Numpy to do high computations and manipulate high dimensional arrays,&nbsp;Matplotlib to plot insightful charts and&nbsp;Pandas to import and manipulate datasets the most efficiently.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">--- Who Is This Course For?&nbsp;---</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">As you can see, there are lots of different tools in the space of Deep Learning and in this course we make sure to show you the most important and most progressive ones so that when you\'re done with Deep Learning A-Z&trade; your skills are on the cutting edge of today\'s technology.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">If you are just starting out into Deep Learning,&nbsp;</span>then you will find this course extremely useful. Deep Learning A-Z&trade; is structured around special coding blueprint approaches meaning that you won\'t get bogged down in unnecessary programming or mathematical complexities and instead you will be applying Deep Learning techniques from very early on in the course.&nbsp;You will build your knowledge from the ground up and you will see how with every tutorial you are getting more and more confident.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">If you already have experience with Deep Learning,&nbsp;</span>you will find this course refreshing, inspiring and very practical. Inside Deep Learning A-Z&trade; you will master some of the most cutting-edge Deep Learning algorithms and techniques (some of which didn\'t even exist a year ago) and through this course you will gain an immense amount of valuable hands-on experience with real-world business challenges. Plus, inside you will find inspiration to explore new Deep Learning skills and applications.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">---&nbsp;Real-World Case Studies ---</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">Mastering Deep Learning is not just about knowing the intuition and tools, it\'s also about being able to apply these models to real-world scenarios and derive actual measurable results for the business or project. That\'s why in this course we are introducing six exciting challenges:</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">#1 Churn Modelling Problem</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">In this part you will be solving a data analytics challenge for a bank. You will be given a dataset with a large sample of the bank\'s customers. To make this dataset, the bank gathered information such as customer id, credit score, gender, age, tenure, balance, if the customer is active, has a credit card, etc. During a period of 6 months, the bank observed if these customers left or stayed in the bank.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">Your goal is to make an Artificial Neural Network that can predict, based on geo-demographical and transactional information given above, if any individual customer will leave the bank or stay (customer churn). Besides, you are asked to rank all the customers of the bank, based on their probability of leaving. To do that, you will need to use the right Deep Learning model, one that is based on a probabilistic approach.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">If you succeed in this project, you will create significant added value to the bank. By applying your Deep Learning model the bank may significantly reduce customer churn.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">#2 Image Recognition</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">In this part, you will create a Convolutional Neural Network that is able to detect various objects in images. We will implement this Deep Learning model to recognize a cat or a dog in a set of pictures. However, this model can be reused to detect anything else and we will show you how to do it - by simply changing the pictures in the input folder.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">For example, you will be able to train the same model on a set of brain images, to detect if they contain a tumor or not. But if you want to keep it fitted to cats and dogs, then you will literally be able to a take a picture of your cat or your dog, and your model will predict which pet you have. We even tested it out on Hadelin&rsquo;s dog!</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">#3&nbsp;Stock Price Prediction</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">In this part, you will create one of the most powerful Deep Learning models. We will even go as far as saying that you will create the Deep Learning model closest to&nbsp;<em style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">&ldquo;Artificial Intelligence&rdquo;</em>. Why is that? Because this model will have long-term memory, just like us, humans.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">The branch of Deep Learning which facilitates this is Recurrent Neural Networks. Classic RNNs have short memory, and were neither popular nor powerful for this exact reason. But a recent major improvement in Recurrent Neural Networks gave rise to the popularity of LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory RNNs) which has completely changed the playing field.&nbsp;We are extremely excited to include these cutting-edge deep learning methods in our course!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">In this part you will learn how to implement this ultra-powerful model, and we will take the challenge to use it to predict the real Google stock price. A similar challenge has already been faced by researchers at Stanford University and we will aim to do at least as good as them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">&nbsp;#4&nbsp;Fraud Detection</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">According to a recent report published by Markets &amp; Markets the Fraud Detection and Prevention Market is going to be worth $33.19 Billion USD by 2021. This is a huge industry and the demand for advanced Deep Learning skills is only going to grow. That&rsquo;s why we have included this case study in the course. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">This is the first part of Volume 2 - Unsupervised Deep Learning Models. The business challenge here is about detecting fraud in credit card applications. You will be creating a Deep Learning model for a bank and you are given a dataset that contains information on customers applying for an advanced credit card.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">This is the data that customers provided when filling the application form. Your task is to detect potential fraud within these applications. That means that by the end of the challenge, you will literally come up with an explicit list of customers who potentially cheated on their applications.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">#5 &amp; 6 Recommender Systems</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">From Amazon product suggestions to Netflix movie recommendations - good recommender systems are very valuable in today\'s World. And specialists who can create them are some of the top-paid Data Scientists on the planet.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">We will work on a dataset that has exactly the same features as the Netflix dataset: plenty of movies, thousands of users, who have rated the movies they watched. The ratings go from 1 to 5, exactly like in the Netflix dataset, which makes the Recommender System more complex to build than if the ratings were simply &ldquo;Liked&rdquo; or &ldquo;Not Liked&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">Your final Recommender System will be able to predict the ratings of the movies the customers didn&rsquo;t watch. Accordingly, by ranking the predictions from 5 down to 1, your Deep Learning model will be able to recommend which movies each user should watch. Creating such a powerful Recommender System is quite a challenge so we will give ourselves two shots. Meaning we will build it with two different Deep Learning models.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">Our first model will be Deep Belief Networks, complex Boltzmann Machines that will be covered in Part 5. Then our second model will be with the powerful AutoEncoders, my personal favorites. You will appreciate the contrast between their simplicity, and what they are capable of.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">And you will even be able to apply it to yourself or your friends. The list of movies will be explicit so you will simply need to rate the movies you already watched, input your ratings in the dataset, execute your model and voila! The Recommender System will tell you exactly which movies you would love one night you if are out of ideas of what to watch on Netflix! &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">---&nbsp;Summary&nbsp;---</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">In conclusion, this is an exciting training program filled with intuition tutorials, practical exercises and real-World case studies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">We are super enthusiastic about Deep Learning and hope to see you inside the class!</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">Kirill &amp;&nbsp;Hadelin</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"audience\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 20px;\" data-purpose=\"course-audience\">\r\n<div class=\"audience__title\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 600; margin: 0px 0px 10px;\">Who is the target audience?</div>\r\n<ul class=\"audience__list\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px; list-style-position: initial; list-style-image: initial; padding: 0px 0px 0px 35px;\">\r\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Anyone interested in Deep Learning</li>\r\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Students who have at least high school knowledge in math and who want to start learning Deep Learning</li>\r\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Any intermediate level people who know the basics of Machine Learning or Deep Learning, including the classical algorithms like linear regression or logistic regression and more advanced topics like Artificial Neural Networks, but who want to learn more about it and explore all the different fields of Deep Learning</li>\r\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Anyone who is not that comfortable with coding but who is interested in Deep Learning and wants to apply it easily on datasets</li>\r\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Any students in college who want to start a career in Data Science</li>\r\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Any data analysts who want to level up in Deep Learning</li>\r\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Any people who are not satisfied with their job and who want to become a Data Scientist</li>\r\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Any people who want to create added value to their business by using powerful Deep Learning tools</li>\r\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Any business owners who want to understand how to leverage the Exponential technology of Deep Learning in their business</li>\r\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Any Entrepreneur who wants to create disruption in an industry using the most cutting edge Deep Learning algorithms</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', '2b19691825c25c9a0933f8547c2a39dc.jpg', '_FwtqXl3iAI', '2018-01-18', 59.9, 29.99),

It&rsquo;s then demonstrated using Python code you can experiment with and build upon, along with notes you can keep for future reference.&nbsp;You won\'t find academic, deeply mathematical coverage of these algorithms in this course - the focus is on practical understanding and application of them. At the end, you\'ll be given a&nbsp;<span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">final project</span>&nbsp;to apply what you\'ve learned!</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">The topics in this course come from an analysis of real requirements in data scientist job listings from the biggest tech employers.

font-weight: bold;\">deep learning, data science,</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span class=\"redactor-inline-converted\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">machine learning</span>&nbsp;series. I&rsquo;ve done a lot of courses about deep learning, and I just released a course about&nbsp;<span class=\"redactor-inline-converted\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">unsupervised learning</span>, where I talked about&nbsp;<span class=\"redactor-inline-converted\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">clustering</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span class=\"redactor-inline-converted\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">density estimation</span>. So what do you get when you put these 2 together? Unsupervised deep learning!</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">In these course we&rsquo;ll start with some very basic stuff -&nbsp;<span class=\"redactor-inline-converted\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">principal components analysis (PCA)</span>, and a popular nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique known as&nbsp;<span class=\"redactor-inline-converted\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding)</span>.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">Next, we&rsquo;ll look at a special type of unsupervised neural network called the&nbsp;<span class=\"redactor-inline-converted\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">autoencoder</span>. After describing how an autoencoder works, I&rsquo;ll show you how you can link a bunch of them together to form a deep stack of autoencoders, that leads to better performance of a supervised<span class=\"redactor-inline-converted\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">&nbsp;deep neural network</span>. Autoencoders are like a non-linear form of PCA.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">Last, we&rsquo;ll look at&nbsp;<span class=\"redactor-inline-converted\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs)</span>. These are yet another popular unsupervised neural network, that you can use in the same way as autoencoders to&nbsp;<span class=\"redactor-inline-converted\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">pretrain</span>&nbsp;your supervised deep neural network. I&rsquo;ll show you an interesting way of training restricted Boltzmann machines, known as&nbsp;<span class=\"redactor-inline-converted\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">Gibbs sampling</span>, a special case of&nbsp;<span class=\"redactor-inline-converted\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">Markov Chain Monte Carlo,</span>&nbsp;and I&rsquo;ll demonstrate how even though this method is only a rough approximation, it still ends up reducing other cost functions, such as the one used for autoencoders. This method is also known as&nbsp;<span class=\"redactor-inline-converted\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">Contrastive Divergence</span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<span class=\"redactor-inline-converted\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">CD-k</span>. As in physical systems, we define a concept called&nbsp;<span class=\"redactor-inline-converted\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">free energy</span>&nbsp;and attempt to minimize this quantity.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">Finally, we&rsquo;ll bring all these concepts together and I&rsquo;ll show you visually what happens when you use PCA and t-SNE on the features that the autoencoders and RBMs have learned, and we&rsquo;ll see that even without labels the results suggest that a pattern has been found.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10.5px;\">All the materials used in this course are FREE. Since this course is the 4th in the deep learning series, I will assume you already know calculus, linear algebra, and&nbsp;<span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">Python</span>&nbsp;coding. You\'ll want to install&nbsp;<span class=\"redactor-inline-converted\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">Numpy,</span>&nbsp;<span class=\"redactor-inline-converted\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">Theano, and Tensorflow</span>&nbsp;for this course.

Anyone can learn to use an API in 15 minutes after reading some documentation. It\'s not about \"remembering facts\", it\'s about&nbsp;<span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">\"seeing for yourself\" via experimentation</span>. It will teach you how to visualize what\'s happening in the model internally.
